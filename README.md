What is this
------------

This is a symbolic equation solver written in Java.

How to build
------------

You need 'ant' installed. Then:

ant && ant run

To enter the REPL

How to use
----------

It is hardcoded to solve for the variable 'x'.

Variables are strings of any length.

Multiplication is not implied, so a2 is a variable named 'a2' and not the expression a*2.

The following operators are supported:

 + (addition)
 - (subtraction)
 * (multiplication)
 / (divison)
 ^ (exponentation)
 ! (factorial)
